# Design / Feature

This feature will add **Aurae Node Authentication**:

A summary of the authentication pattern is as follows:

* An aurae node is a self-contained runtime environment.
* An operator is an entity that controls an aurae node.
* The aurae node acts as an automated agent for the operator.
* The operator may choose to link the node to an OIDC identity through a successful challenge.
* The operator may validate another operator by demonstrating proof that the challenge occurred successfully

### Example Use Cases

#### Single Auraed Node
At its simplest, the operator should be able to instantiate auraed without any federation capabilities. This is useful for small one-off nodes, development, and air-gapped environments. A set of keys will be generated automatically for the node, but will not automatically be correlated with any external identity.

#### Multiple Auraed Nodes operated by a Single Entity
The operator may choose to federate multiple nodes under their own control with each other. Each node must be uniquely identifiable, allowing for cryptographic control over the membership of the federated nodes. For example, the operator may choose to add or drop an auraed node.

For this use case, we **only** consider membership, not authorization.

#### Federated Auraed Nodes operated by a single entity
The operator may choose to federate multiple sets of aurae nodes with each other. For example, the operator may be the custodian of two or more sets of nodes.

#### Globally Federated Aurae Nodes
The operator registers themselves with a global identity server, allowing aurae nodes to mutually identify each other.

### Outcomes

The outcome of this will allow for:
* An operator to authenticate themself to a node.
* An authenticated operator to control an aurae node.
* An aurae node to federate with other nodes.

The outcome of **feature** will unlock the ability for aurae nodes to interact
with external entities.

### Goals
